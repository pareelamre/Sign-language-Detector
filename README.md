# Sign-language-Detector
This detector recognizes the hand signs 'Hello', 'I love you' and 'Thank you' using action recognition

As part of this assignment, I learned how to build a detection model to decode sign language.
Method
The following processes were followed to achieve the desired result:
1.	Install and import dependencies
2.	Detect face, hand and pose landmarks
3.	Extract keypoints
4.	Collect keypoint sequences
5.	Preprocess data and create labels
6.	Build and train Long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network
7.	Make sign language predictions
8.	Save model weights
9.	Evaluation using a confusion matrix
